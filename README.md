# Kmeans

The K-means algorithm is a clustering method for finding a partition of N unlabeled
observations into K distinct clusters, where K is a parameter of the method. 

The algorithm is implemented both in C and in Python :)

Compile line for C: $gcc -ansi -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic-errors kmeans.c -o kmeans
After successfully running the above command run the program by executing the following line (example): $./kmeans 3 100 <input_data.txt

for Python: $python3 kmeans.py 3 100 input_data.txt
